   -CodeBook.md:Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
   -run_analysis.R: Script that performs the data preparation and the 5 steps outlined in the Course Project Requirements:
        Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
        Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
        From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

    -Results.txt is the exported final data.
